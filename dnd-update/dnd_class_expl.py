The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel. The interior is appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel as if you were in its space.

You exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel's former space. Once you enter the vessel, you can't enter again until you finish a long rest.Genie's Wrath - Once during each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your Proficiency Bonus, or {player.profbonus}. The type of this damage is determined by your patron: bludgeoning (dao), thunder (djinni), fire (efreeti), or cold (marid).\nThe vessel's AC equals your spell save DC, or {player.spellsavedc["Warlock Spell Save DC"]}. Its hit points equal your Warlock level + your Proficiency Bonus, or {player.warlvl + player.profbonus} hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.\nIf the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.
